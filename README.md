## An article that I wrote after developing this project:
https://medium.com/@nishit.mehta1/your-guide-to-deploying-mern-stack-app-on-heroku-ffdc3e0685e3?source=friends_link&sk=0107c94a2d0c390cba8038485e624a00

## Frameworks and Technologies Used:
* MongoDb
* ExpressJs
* Reactjs
* Node
* Postman
* NPM
* HTML, CSS

## What I learnt from this:
* Loading data from MongoDb Database
* Setting up a server using Express to connect MongoDb (through mongoose)
* Making HTTP calls using axios in the frontEnd
* Using middleware such as cors
* Deploying apps to Heroku
* Passing props and states to components

## To run locally
* Download/Pull the master branch
* Redirect terminal to the project folder
* Redirect to BackEnd
* Type 'nodemon server' and hit enter
* Go to frontENd and hit 'npm start'

Make sure Mongo server is running and a todos named collection is present.
